# Time planning

## Ways to manage time

1. Using a task list to track tasks which need to be completed

   - I have already been using this method for some time.
   - When working on multiple projects and it is easy to start forgetting things.
   - Using a simple application to track all the tasks that need to be done makes it easy to keep track of what is done what is left.
   - It also helps me prioritize more important tasks first.

2. Minimizing distractions
   - It is really easy to get distracted when trying to work. Especially if working from home.
   - One solution could be turning off notifications and putting any phones on silent.
   - Another thing is using a separate work computer.
   - In cases when work is done from home, it might be good to have an office room or similar where distractions are not present.

### Difference beteen `C` and `I`:

- The **C** category (Consulted) is for people who difine what the tasks or goals of a project are. They are the people that provide feedback which is actively used by people in the **R** category.

- The **I** category (Informed) is for people who need to be kept up to date with the status of a project, but may not be directly working on it.

### Can one person appear in multiple categories?
