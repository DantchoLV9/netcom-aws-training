# STAR: Learn and be curious

## Situation:

Years ago I had started learning React. I was getting better at it, however I was still lacking the experience needed to start using it for my own projects or work.

## Task:

I had to learn how to use the specific features that React offers.

## Action:

I decided to do a challenge called 100 days of code. 

## Result:

By the end of the challenge I was feeling very comfortable working with React.
