# Pseudo code

# 1. Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it as "number"
# 2. Ask user to guess a number between 1 and 10 and store it as "guess"
# 3. If "guess" is equal to "number" then tell the user they won, and exit the program
# 4. If "guess" is not equal to "number" then tell thhe user to try again, and jump back to step 2
